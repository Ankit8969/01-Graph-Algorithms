This Algorithms is is very easy and it is also known as Khan's Algorithm

Step:

First take a queqe data-structure
store all the nodes in the queue whose indegree is zero

Pop the element one by one 
and decrease the indegree of all the adjecent node to that node and if it zero than again push into the queue.
