/* Complete Graph means every node is connected with every other nodes */
/* This algorithm also gives the shortest distance from any one of the node to all other node */

Time Complexity : O(n^3)

Min : O(n^2)
If the graph is complete than time complexit is  O(n^3)

Drawback...........
This Algorithm does't work when the weight of cycle is -ve.

By using this algorithm we can check does the cycle in the graph has -ve weight or not.
If we already relaxed (n-1) times again doing one more time if the relaxing occur then we can say that the cycle which is present in graph has -ve weight.
